## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

Considering the fact that this was my first Javascript project, I couldn't just jump right into the coding part.

I had to first make sure I understood the problem by writing it in plain English ("the user will select rock, paper, or scissors at random. the computer will select at random as well. the winner of each round, determined by classic rock/paper/scissors rules, will receive a point. best out of three rounds wins"). This helped me answer a few questions - what input will my program have? Will the user enter data or will the input be received elsewhere? What is the desired output? Given my inputs, what necessary steps return the desired output? To answer the last question, I wrote pseudocode.

This step-by-step process was incredibly helpful. It broke down the problem I had to solve into manageable subproblems. The only other issue I encountered was figuring out how exactly to receive the user's input into Javascript via the buttons, and then how to execute certain blocks of code based on the selection. I used an incredible amount of functions - I think I have under 5 lines of code that aren't in a function. I believe this is best practice due to variable scope and because good function names serve as comments as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that being a programmer is more than just writing lines of code. The main skill a programmer needs to have is problem solving. Writing code is secondary.
